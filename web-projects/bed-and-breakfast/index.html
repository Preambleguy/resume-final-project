            <h2>Where Nature and Comfort Meet</h2>
            <img src="img/hotel-lobby-piano.jpg" alt="The grand piano is the heart of the inn's lobby">
            <p>Nestled among whispering birch trees, Burch Tree Inn offers a peaceful retreat from the everyday. With
                soft mountain air and the scent of pine drifting through open windows, it's the perfect place to unwind
                and reconnect with nature.</p>

            <img src="img/hotel-room-example.jpg" alt="The garden room is one of our cozy room offerings">
            <p>Our rooms blend rustic charm with modern comfort — handcrafted wood furnishings, cozy linens, and views
                of the surrounding forest make every stay feel timeless. In the evenings, guests can gather around our
                lobby and enjoy the gentle melodies from our grand piano, a centerpiece of the inn's serene and
                welcoming atmosphere.</p>

                room overlooking the woods. Whether you're here for a weekend getaway or a quiet escape, Burch Tree Inn
                invites you to slow down, breathe deep, and feel at home in the heart of nature.</p>
